# Chapa Payment Gateway Integration - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the Chapa Payment Gateway integration for the ALX Travel Application (0x02 version).

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Models**

#### Payment Model (`listings/models.py`)
```python
class Payment(models.Model):
    PAYMENT_STATUS_CHOICES = [
        ('pending', 'Pending'),
        ('completed', 'Completed'),
        ('failed', 'Failed'),
        ('cancelled', 'Cancelled'),
    ]
    
    payment_id = UUID (Primary Key)
    booking = OneToOneField(Booking)
    amount = DecimalField
    currency = CharField (default: 'ETB')
    status = CharField (choices above)
    transaction_id = CharField (unique, Chapa transaction ID)
    chapa_reference = CharField (unique, Chapa tx_ref)
    payment_method = CharField
    created_at = DateTimeField
    updated_at = DateTimeField
    completed_at = DateTimeField (nullable)
    error_message = TextField (nullable)
```

**Features:**
- Tracks payment transactions for bookings
- Stores transaction IDs and references
- Records error messages for failed payments
- Timestamps for audit trail

### 2. **API Endpoints**

#### Booking Endpoints (Extended)
- `POST /api/bookings/{id}/initiate_payment/`
  - Initiates payment for a booking
  - Returns checkout URL and payment ID
  - Only accessible to booking guest

#### Payment Endpoints (New)
- `GET /api/payments/` - List user's payments
- `GET /api/payments/{id}/` - Get payment details
- `POST /api/payments/{id}/verify_status/` - Verify payment with Chapa
- `POST /api/payments/verify/` - Webhook callback endpoint

### 3. **API Views**

#### PaymentViewSet (`listings/views.py`)
```
- List payments (filtered by user)
- Retrieve payment details
- verify_status() - Verify payment with Chapa
- verify() - Handle webhook callbacks
```

**Key Features:**
- Permission checks (only accessible to relevant users)
- Automatic payment status updates
- Email notification triggers
- Transaction logging

### 4. **Chapa API Integration**

#### ChapaAPIClient (`listings/chapa_utils.py`)
```python
class ChapaAPIClient:
    def initiate_payment(payment_obj, booking_obj)
    def verify_payment(transaction_reference)
```

**Features:**
- Secure API credential management
- Error handling and logging
- Request timeout handling
- Response parsing and validation

#### Helper Functions
- `create_payment_for_booking()` - Auto-create payment when booking created
- `update_payment_status()` - Update payment status and booking

### 5. **Email Notifications**

#### Email Tasks (`listings/email_tasks.py`)
- `send_payment_confirmation_email()` - HTML formatted confirmation
- `send_payment_failure_email()` - Failure notification

**Features:**
- Professional HTML templates
- Plain text fallback
- Transaction details included
- Automated on payment completion

### 6. **Serializers**

#### PaymentSerializer (`listings/serializers.py`)
```python
class PaymentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    - Read-only: payment_id, transaction_id, chapa_reference
    - Writable: amount, currency, status
    - Nested: booking details
```

### 7. **Admin Interface**

#### Payment Admin (`listings/admin.py`)
```python
@admin.register(Payment)
class PaymentAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    - List view with key fields
    - Filtering by status, currency, date
    - Search by payment_id, transaction_id
    - Detailed fieldset organization
    - Readonly transaction fields
```

### 8. **Database Migration**

#### Migration File (`listings/migrations/0002_payment.py`)
- Creates Payment table
- Defines all fields and constraints
- Establishes relationship with Booking

### 9. **Configuration & Environment**

#### Enhanced .env File
```env
CHAPA_SECRET_KEY=your-api-key
CHAPA_API_URL=https://api.chapa.co/v1
CHAPA_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/payments/verify/
EMAIL_BACKEND=...
CELERY_BROKER_URL=...
```

#### Updated requirements.txt
- Added: python-dotenv, requests, celery, redis

#### Celery Configuration
- `/alx_travel_app/celery.py` - Celery setup for async tasks

## 🔄 Payment Workflow

```
User Creates Booking
        ↓
Payment Record Created (Status: Pending)
        ↓
User Initiates Payment
        ↓
System Calls Chapa API
        ↓
Chapa Returns Checkout URL
        ↓
User Completes Payment on Chapa
        ↓
User Verifies Payment
        ↓
System Calls Chapa Verification
        ↓
On Success:
  - Payment Status → Completed
  - Booking Status → Confirmed
  - Email Sent to User
        ↓
Transaction Complete
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### Payment Table Relationships
```
Booking (1) ──── (1) Payment
   |
   └─ guest → User (email for notifications)
   └─ listing → Listing (property details)
```

### Payment Record Structure
- UUID primary key
- OneToOne relationship with Booking
- Status enum (pending/completed/failed/cancelled)
- Transaction tracking fields
- Timestamp audit trail

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Django 5.2.7** - Web framework
- **Django REST Framework 3.16.1** - API development
- **Requests 2.31.0** - HTTP client for Chapa API
- **Celery 5.3.4** - Async task processing (optional)
